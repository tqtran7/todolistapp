This project demonstrates how to setup a NextJS application with Tailwind for a todo application. It requires the server application to run properly. To get started, install the dependencies and start the server.

## Instructions

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to `localhost:3000` to verify that the server is running.
